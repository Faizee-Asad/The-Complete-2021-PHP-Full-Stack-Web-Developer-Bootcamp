OOP stands for Object Oriented Programming

OOP is a programming pattern or style using which you can create small code group based on real life objects, Object like, car , users, bank, cat, Dog ...

The main purpose of OOP is to create reusable code.

OOP is a programming style.

OOP brings modularity to your code. 

You think and convert your code into real life objects and use it.

POP

Define variable
Define function
Define Logical
Flow of program
Sequential flow.

OOP

Think of component
Define component
what variable and function can be in that component.


MAIN KEY.

Start thinking in object.

(Consider everythings is an object)

Thinking in OOP.

Everything in the world can be defined as an object.

start thinking and organise your code into smaller components and real life objcts.
 
Stop thinking in procedure - variables and functions.

In OOP variable and function name are changed. variable = properties and function = method.


class is a blueprint of object.

class is a logical grouping of code with variable and fuctions specific to the object.

The main purpose of class is to organize your code into individual components.

Example:

car is class. (something which is not real but a specifiction)
BMW car is object. (object are real can be used)

Organize in class:

car class
phone class
video class
db class
file class 
email class
user class

organise car class

variable:
name 
color
function:
set the name
set the color
display the name and color.

one class describe about one object's variables and fuctions.

one class is represented one object.

<!-- Best practices

Class name first letter should starts with Captital letters.
file name should match wiht class name. easy to follow.
one file should have one class. you can have multiple.
class is the keyword used to define a class.
class is opened and closed with {} like functions.
 -->


class won't give you an output.
