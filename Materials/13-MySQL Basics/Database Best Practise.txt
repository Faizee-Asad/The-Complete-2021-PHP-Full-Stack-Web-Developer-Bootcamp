Database Best Practise
Avoid duplicated data, normalize (define) as much as possible -- Not always possible, but should

be the objective.

Use a modeling/design tool designed for schema modeling -- Graphical representation

Model the data store to mirror the domain model (define) as much as possible -- good design

practice

Avoid the wildcard select *, query the columns needed -- saves memory and is higher

performance

Qualify your tables with aliases especially with join queries -- more human readable

Use a SQL management tool (MySQL workbench / PhpMyAdmin) to test queries
