Input data coming into your application from an outside source should be looked at from a perspective of distrust.

Input data from the outside includes:

user data via a form submit request

one or more database stores

web service requests

any source not directly coded in your application

FILTER_VALIDATE_EMAIL: Validates e-mail addresses (comment and whitespace folding are

not supported)

FILTER_SANITIZE_EMAIL: Removes all characters except letters, digits and !#$%&'*+-=?

^_`{|}~@.[]



Sample Code:

$emailAddress = 't(es)t@example.com';

if ( filter_var( $emailAddress, FILTER_VALIDATE_EMAIL )) {

echo $emailAddress . ' seems legit . <br/>';

} else {

echo filter_var( $emailAddress, FILTER_SANITIZE_EMAIL);

}
